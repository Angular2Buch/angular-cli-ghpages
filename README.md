Deploy your Angular app to GitHub pages directly from the Angular CLI! üöÄ


## üìñ Changelog <a name="changelog"></a>

A detailed changelog is available in the [releases](https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages/releases) section.

In the past this project was a standalone program.
This is still possible.  
See the documentation at [README_standalone](README_standalone).


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

This command has the following prerequisites:

- Git 1.9 or higher (execute `git --version` to check your version)
- Angular project created via [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)


## üöÄ Quick-start (local development) <a name="quickstart-local"></a>

This quickstart assumes that you are starting from scratch.
If you alreay have an existing Angular project on GitHub, skip step 1 and 2.

1. Install the next version of the Angular CLI (v8.3.0-next.0 or greater)
   and create a new Angular project.

   ```sh
   npm install -g @angular/cli@next
   ng new your-angular-project --defaults
   cd your-angular-project
   ```

2. By default the Angular CLI initializes a git repository for you.  
   To add a new remote for GitHub, use the `git remote add` command:

   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repositoryname>.git
   ```

   Hints:  
   * Create a new empty GithHub repository first.
   * Replace `<username>` and `<repositoryname>` with your username from GitHub and the name of your new repository. 
   * Please enter the URL `https://github.com/<username>/<repositoryname>.git` into your browser ‚Äì you should see your existing repository on GitHub. 
   * Please double-check that you have the necessary rights to make changes to the given project!  

3. Add `angular-cli-ghpages` to your project.

   ```sh
   ng add angular-cli-ghpages
   ```

4. Deploy your project to Github pages with all default settings.
   Your project will be automatically build in production mode.

   ```sh
   ng run your-angular-project:deploy
   ```

5. Your project should be available at `http(s)://<username>.github.io/<projectname>`.
   Learn more about GitHub pages on the [official website](https://pages.github.com/).


## üöÄ Continuous Delivery <a name="continuous-delivery"></a>

If you run this command on a CI/CD environment, the deployment will most likely not work out of the box.
For security reasons, those environments usually have read-only privileges.
Therefore you should take a look at [Github tokens](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/).
In short: a Github token replaces username and password and can be invalidated at any time.

All you need to do is set an environment variable called `GH_TOKEN` in our CI/CD environment.
You should also set the URL to the repository using the `--repo` option.
The URL must use the HTTPS scheme.

```sh
ng run your-angular-project:deploy --repo=https://github.com/<username>/<repositoryname>.git --name="Your Git Username" --email=your.mail@example.org
```

(replace `<username>` and `<repositoryname>` with your username from GitHub and the name of your repository)

> Please __do NOT disable the silent mode__ if you have any credentials in the repository URL!
> You have to treat the GH_TOKEN as secure as a password!


## Options

- `--base-href` - specifies the base url for the application being built. Same as `ng build --base-href=XXX`.
- `--configuration`
- TODO: document all the other options! 


## üèÅ Next milestones <a name="milestones"></a>

We are glad that we have an integration into the CLI again.
But we are looking forward to the following features:

* an interactive command-line prompt that guides you through the available options 
* a configuration file (`angular-cli-ghpages.json`) to avoid all these command-line cmd options

We look forward to any help. PRs are welcome! üòÉ
